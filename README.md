Chord Crazy
============

From Major Triad to Major Scale
-------------------------------

The usual way to learn a major triad is to learn the major scale and then pick out the first,
third, and fifth notes of the scale to form the major triad.

Chord Crazy reverses this process. First, you learn a simple mnemonic technique to form the major triads chords.
Then you use the mnemonic and practice playing the three notes in the major triad of a major scale.
Finally, you learn and practice playing the other four notes in the major scale.
